Configuration
=============
By default, Application Menu does not have access to user specific 
``Applications`` directory (located in the 
``~/Users/<username>/Applications``). In order to be able to list 
those applications in the Application Menu, you will need to grant 
access to mentioned directory. That can be done in the application ``Settings``, 
as shown below:
